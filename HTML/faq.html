    <p>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) About Ramadan
        1. What is Ramadan?
        Ramadan is the ninth month of the Islamic lunar calendar and is observed by Muslims worldwide as a month of fasting, prayer, reflection, and community. It is one of the Five Pillars of Islam.
        
        2. When does Ramadan start and end?
        Ramadan begins with the sighting of the new moon and lasts for 29 or 30 days, depending on the lunar cycle. The exact start date varies each year and by location. You can check our website for the confirmed start date of Ramadan in your region.
        
        3. How is the start of Ramadan determined?
        The start of Ramadan is determined by the sighting of the crescent moon (Hilal). Islamic authorities in each country announce the official start date based on moon sightings or astronomical calculations.
        
        4. What are the prayer times during Ramadan?
        Prayer times during Ramadan are the same as throughout the year but with special emphasis on the five daily prayers (Fajr, Dhuhr, Asr, Maghrib, and Isha). Additionally, Taraweeh prayers are performed after Isha during Ramadan. You can find the exact prayer times for your location on our website.
        
        5. What is Suhoor and Iftar?
        Suhoor: The pre-dawn meal eaten before the Fajr prayer to begin the daily fast.
        
        Iftar: The meal eaten after sunset to break the fast, starting with the Maghrib prayer.
        
        6. Can I use your website to find Suhoor and Iftar times?

        7. What is Taraweeh prayer?
        Taraweeh is a special nightly prayer performed during Ramadan. It is offered in congregation at mosques and consists of additional units of prayer (rakats) after the Isha prayer.
        
        8. How can I find the Qibla direction for prayer?

        9. What if I have a medical condition and cannot fast?
        If you have a medical condition that prevents you from fasting, Islam provides exemptions. You can make up for missed fasts later or provide Fidya (feeding a needy person) if you are unable to fast at all. Consult with a knowledgeable scholar or imam for guidance.
